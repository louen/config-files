config-files
============

Ensemble of configuration files I use on linux systems (and 
sometimes windows and mac). 

I don't know if configuration files are licensable or not.
In case they are, most of them originate from Formation Debian 
(http://formation-debian.via.ecp.fr)
which is under the General Public Licence v2.

Unless stated otherwise within the file, you can therefore 
considerate that each file is a free software under the terms
of the GPLv2, which is enclosed in this repository.
