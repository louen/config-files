# The quest for the perfect vim

`vim` rules. Vim is useful everywhere but it needs configuration.
Sometimes different configurations for different use cases.
This is mainly a doc for me as I was building the perfect vimrc for me.

Note : `vim -u config_file` to force the use of a given config

## The minimal vimrc

Many vim tutorials recommend using the smallest possible vimrc
to start with. This way it is possible to get familiar with the 
editor without resorting to tricks and tweaks. It also allows
a better understanding of which setting changes what.

I used Ben Orenstein's minimal vimrc for starters, with 
a few tweaks of my own, which is in `vimrc.minimal`

## A good console editor

## A good graphical editor

## Compatibility across OS

## A replacement for your IDE
